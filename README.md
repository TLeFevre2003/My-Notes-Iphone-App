# Overview

The goal of this project was to learn the basics of mobile development on iOS. I am interested in mobile development
so I decided to start learning by creating a small app.

The app that I developed is a note taking app. It is really easy to use.
Click the plus on the top right to add a note, click on notes themselves to eddit them,
and hold a note to bring up the delete button.

My purpose for creating a note app was because it only needs a few things, and as you learn more
and get better you can implement more functionality into the app.

{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration.  It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the app running and a walkthrough of the code.}

# Development Environment

The tools I used were a macbook with xcode, and an iphone to test the app on.


The programming language I used was Swift and used two libraries, SwiftUI and SwiftData.
SwiftUI handles the user input and SwiftData handles the data.

# Future Work

* Folders, I would like to add folders as a way to organize notes.
* Better note editor, I am not really a fan of the text box used to write notes I would like to improve it.
* When folders are added I would like to be able to swipe left and right to cycle through folders kind of like the photos app.
